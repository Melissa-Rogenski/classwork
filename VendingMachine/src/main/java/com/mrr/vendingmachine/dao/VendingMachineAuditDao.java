 * Purpose: interface to be implemented by the VendingMachineAuditDaoImpl class file
 * This interface defines the methods that must be implemented by any class that
 * wants to play the role of AuditDAO in the application.
 *         
 * The VendingMachineServiceLayerImpl only uses this interface to reference the DAO â€” it 
 * is completely unaware of the implementation details.
